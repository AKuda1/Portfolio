# About Me
Hello! I'm a passionate and results-driven professional with a strong background in project management who is currently undergoing an exciting transition into the world of data analytics. My journey has been marked by a continuous pursuit of knowledge and a thirst for new challenges, and I'm eager to share my story with you.

**Background:** With several years of experience as a project manager, I have developed a keen eye for detail, effective communication skills, and the ability to drive complex projects to successful outcomes. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with diverse teams, managing budgets, and meeting tight deadlines â€“ skills that I believe are transferable to the field of data analytics.

**Why Data?** My transition into the data industry is motivated by a profound curiosity about the stories that data can tell. I've always been fascinated by the power of data to inform decision-making, improve processes, and drive business growth. As a project manager, I often found myself relying on data-driven insights to make strategic decisions, which led me to explore this field further.

**Education and Training:** To prepare for this transition, I have invested time in acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge. I've completed courses and certifications in Data Science, SQL, data visualization, and programming languages such as Python. I believe that this foundation, combined with my project management experience, will allow me to excel in this new role. I am currently a Senior at NIU majoring in Operations Management & Information Systems.

**Skills:** Some of the skills I've developed as a project manager, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and the ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously, are directly applicable to data analytics. I'm also well-versed in project management software and tools, which can be valuable in the context of data projects.

**What I Bring:** My experience as a project manager equips me with a unique perspective. I understand the importance of aligning data analysis with organizational objectives and how to communicate the findings effectively to stakeholders. I also appreciate the importance of managing projects within scope, budget, and schedule, which can be beneficial when working on data projects.

**Goals:** As I transition into data analytics, my goal is to leverage data to drive insights, solve complex problems, and support data-informed decision-making within organizations. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my project management experience to data projects, ensuring they are well-organized, efficient, and yield actionable results.
